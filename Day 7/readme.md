# 100 Days of Coding - Day 7

## Code Overview

Welcome to Day 7 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will continue exploring Python programming concepts. Today, we'll cover topics such as break and continue statements, functions, and passing arguments.

The code in `main.py` demonstrates the following concepts:

## Break & Continue

The code showcases the usage of `break` and `continue` statements in loops. It includes two examples:

- The first loop counts from 1 to 20 and breaks the loop when the value of `i` is equal to 10.
- The second loop counts from 1 to 12 and skips the iteration when the value of `i` is equal to 10.

## Functions

The code defines several functions and demonstrates their usage:

- The `Addition()` function takes two arguments and prints the addition of the numbers.
- The `temp()` function is a placeholder function that does nothing. It is included as an example of an empty function.
- The `avg()` function uses the `*` operator to accept a variable number of arguments (as a tuple). It calculates the average of the given numbers and prints the result.
- The `names()` function uses the `**` operator to accept keyword arguments. It prints a greeting message using the provided first name (`fname`) and last name (`lname`).
- The `justreturn()` function takes two arguments, performs an addition, and returns the result. The returned value is then printed.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and run it to see the output. Modify the code or experiment with different values to deepen your understanding of break and continue statements, functions, and passing arguments.
