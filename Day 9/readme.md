# 100 Days of Coding - Day 9

## Code Overview

Welcome to Day 9 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will continue exploring Python programming concepts related to tuples.

## Code Details

The code in `main.py` demonstrates the following operations with tuples:

### Tuple Basics

- We create a tuple named 'tup' with a mix of integers and strings.
- The type of 'tup' is printed along with its contents.
- The length of the 'tup' tuple is calculated and printed.
- The first element of the 'tup' tuple is accessed and printed.
- Slicing is demonstrated by printing a subset of elements from index 1 to 2 (exclusive) in the 'tup' tuple.

### Tuple Concatenation

- We create another tuple named 'tup1' containing three integers.
- 'tup' and 'tup1' are concatenated into a new tuple named 'fin', and the result is printed.

### Tuple to List and Back to Tuple

- A tuple named 'names' is created with a series of names.
- The 'names' tuple is converted into a list 'temp'.
- "Josh" is added to the end of the 'temp' list, and the first element ("Fahad") is removed.
- The modified 'temp' list is converted back into a tuple named 'names', and the result is printed.

### Tuple Element Count

- A tuple named 'numbers' is created with multiple occurrences of the value 8.
- The number of occurrences of the value 8 in the 'numbers' tuple is counted and printed.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and run it to see the output. Observe how tuples are used and modified in various ways throughout the code.
