# 100 Days of Coding - Day 3

## String Slicing and Quick Quiz

Welcome to Day 3 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will explore various programming concepts and improve our coding skills through daily coding exercises. Today, we'll focus on string slicing and tackle a quick quiz.

## String Slicing

String slicing is the process of extracting a portion of a string by specifying the start and end indices. It allows us to work with specific sections of a string. In today's code, we have several examples demonstrating string slicing.

The code includes examples like printing substrings based on index ranges and utilizing negative indices to extract portions of the string. By understanding string slicing, you can manipulate and access different parts of a string effectively.

## Quick Quiz

As part of today's challenge, there is a quick quiz at the end of the code. The variable `nm` is assigned the value "Harry". The code then prints `nm[-4:-2]`. Take a moment to think about the expected output before running the code.

## Code Overview

The `main.py` file contains the code for today's challenge. It demonstrates various string slicing techniques and provides comments to explain each step. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different values to deepen your understanding of string slicing.

To run the code, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the code file is located, and execute the command `python main.py`. Observe the output and compare it to the explanations provided in the comments.

## Resources

To learn more about string slicing and related topics, you can refer to the following resources:

- [Python Documentation on Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)
