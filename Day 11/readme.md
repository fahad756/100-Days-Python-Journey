# 100 Days of Coding - Day 11

## Concepts to Learn

Welcome to Day 11 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! Today, we will focus on three important concepts in Python:

1. F-Strings (Formatted String Literals):
   - F-Strings are a new and convenient way of formatting strings in Python, introduced in Python 3.6.
   - They provide an elegant syntax for embedding variables and expressions within strings.
   - You can use F-Strings by prefixing the string with the letter "f" (e.g., `f"Hello, {name}!"`).
   - Inside the F-String, you can directly include variables and expressions in curly braces `{}`.

2. Docstrings:
   - Docstrings are used to provide documentation for functions, modules, and classes in Python.
   - They are enclosed within triple quotes (single or double) and appear as the first statement in the function or module.
   - Docstrings provide essential information about the purpose, usage, and behavior of the code they document.
   - Properly documented code with descriptive docstrings enhances code readability and maintainability.

3. PEP 8 - Python Enhancement Proposal 8:
   - PEP 8 is the official style guide for writing Python code.
   - It provides guidelines for formatting, naming conventions, and overall coding style to make Python code more readable and consistent.
   - Following PEP 8 ensures that your code is easily understandable by other developers and is more likely to be well-received in the Python community.

## Examples and Usage

- We will explore different examples of F-Strings to format strings with variables and numerical values, including limiting decimal places for floats.
- Docstrings will be demonstrated with a simple function, explaining how to use them to document code.
- We will discuss the key points of PEP 8 and how adhering to the style guide benefits your Python projects.

## Zen of Python

As an additional bonus, we will briefly introduce the "Zen of Python." It is a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in Python, expressed as aphorisms. The Zen of Python encourages simplicity, readability, and maintainability in Python code.

## Resources

To deepen your understanding of F-Strings, Docstrings, PEP 8, and the Zen of Python, you can refer to the following resources:

- [PEP 498 - Formatted String Literals](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/)
- [PEP 257 - Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
- [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

Happy learning and coding on Day 11 of the challenge! Keep up the great work!
