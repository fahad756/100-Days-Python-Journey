# 100 Days of Coding - Day 4

## String Methods

Welcome to Day 4 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will explore various programming concepts and improve our coding skills through daily coding exercises. Today, we'll focus on string methods.

## Introduction to String Methods

String methods in Python provide various operations to manipulate and work with strings. They allow us to perform actions such as converting the case of a string, replacing substrings, splitting strings into lists, finding characters or substrings, checking string properties, and more.

## Code Overview

In the `script.py` file, you'll find code examples that demonstrate different string methods and their functionalities. Each method is applied to different strings to showcase its usage and provide insights into the results. The code is thoroughly commented to explain each step and the purpose of each string method used.

The code includes examples of the following string methods:
- `upper()`: Converts a string to uppercase.
- `lower()`: Converts a string to lowercase.
- `rstrip()`: Removes trailing characters from a string.
- `replace()`: Replaces a specified substring with another substring.
- `split()`: Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.
- `capitalize()`: Converts the first character of a string to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
- `center()`: Centers a string within a specified width by padding it with spaces.
- `count()`: Counts the occurrences of a substring in a string.
- `find()`: Finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string and returns its index.
- `index()`: Finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string and returns its index (raises an error if not found).
- `isalpha()`: Checks if a string consists of alphabetic characters only.
- `isnumeric()`: Checks if a string consists of numeric characters only.
- `isalnum()`: Checks if a string consists of alphanumeric characters only.
- `isprintable()`: Checks if a string is printable (i.e., all characters can be printed).
- `isspace()`: Checks if a string consists of whitespace characters only.
- `istitle()`: Checks if a string is in title case.
- `swapcase()`: Swaps the case of characters in a string.
- `title()`: Converts the first character of each word in a string to title case.

Feel free to explore the code, run it, and observe the output. Modify the code or experiment with different values to deepen your understanding of string methods.
