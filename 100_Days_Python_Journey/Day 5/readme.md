# 100 Days of Coding - Day 5

## Assignment Question

Q: Write a program that gets the current time and determines the time of day. Based on the hour value, the program should display a corresponding greeting message:

## Introduction to Time, OS, and Conditional Statements

Welcome to Day 5 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will explore various programming concepts and improve our coding skills through daily coding exercises. Today, we'll focus on time operations, the OS module, and conditional statements.

## Time Operations

The code utilizes the `time` module to work with time-related operations. It demonstrates how to get the current time, extract the hour from it, and print a corresponding greeting based on the time of day.

## OS Module

The `os` module is used to execute operating system commands. In this code, it executes the `python --version` command and prints the Python version.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements, such as if-elif-else, allow us to perform different actions based on specific conditions. In this code, conditional statements are used to check the hour value and print a corresponding greeting based on the time of day.

## Code Overview

In the `Main.py` file, you'll find code examples that demonstrate time operations, the usage of the OS module, and conditional statements. The code provides the current time, extracts the hour, and determines the time of day (morning, afternoon, or night) based on the hour value.

Feel free to explore the code, run it, and observe the output. Modify the code or experiment with different values to deepen your understanding of time operations, working with the OS module, and using conditional statements.

## Resources

To learn more about time operations, the OS module, and conditional statements, you can refer to the following resources:
