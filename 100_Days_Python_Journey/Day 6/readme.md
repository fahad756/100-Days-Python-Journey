# 100 Days of Coding - Day 6

## Loops

Welcome to Day 6 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will explore loops in Python.

## Code Overview

The code provided demonstrates the usage of loops in Python. It includes the following examples:

1. **For loop**: Iterates over each character in a string and each element in a list. It prints each character and element during the iteration.

2. **Range function**: Shows the usage of the `range` function to loop a specific number of times or with a specific step size. It prints the current value of `i` during each iteration.

3. **While loop**: Executes a loop until a specific condition is met. It includes examples of both incrementing and decrementing loops. It also demonstrates the usage of the `else` statement with a while loop.

4. **Infinite loop**: Demonstrates how to create an infinite loop using the `while True` construct. It breaks out of the loop when the condition `i % 100 == 0` is met.

Feel free to explore the code, run it, and observe the output. Modify the code or experiment with different values to deepen your understanding of loops in Python.
