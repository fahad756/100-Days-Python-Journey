# 100 Days of Coding - Day 2

## First Excercie

Welcome to Day 2 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will explore various programming concepts and improve our coding skills through daily coding exercises. Today, we'll dive into the concept of type casting and also work on a calculator exercise.

## Type Casting

Welcome to Day 2 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will explore various programming concepts and improve our coding skills through daily coding exercises. Today, we'll dive into the concept of type casting.

Type casting refers to the process of converting one data type into another. It allows us to change the interpretation or representation of data. In programming languages like Python, type casting plays a crucial role in manipulating and manipulating data of different types.

## Code Overview

In today's code snippet, we'll cover the following topics related to type casting:

- Concatenating strings: We'll explore how strings can be concatenated using the '+' operator.

- Adding integers: We'll see how integers can be added using the '+' operator.

- Conversion: We'll learn how to convert strings to integers using the 'int()' function.

- Types of type casting:
  - Explicit type casting: We'll manually convert data types using functions like 'int()', 'float()', 'str()', etc.
  - Implicit type casting: We'll observe how Python automatically performs type conversion when necessary.

The code file [main.py](main.py) contains the code examples with detailed comments explaining each step. You can run the code and see the output for better understanding.
