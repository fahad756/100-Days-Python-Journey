# 100 Days of Coding - Day 10

## Quiz Game - KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati)

Welcome to Day 10 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we have created a simple KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati) Quiz Game using Python.

## Description

The KBC Quiz Game is a text-based quiz game inspired by the popular Indian television show "Kaun Banega Crorepati." The objective of the game is to answer a series of questions and accumulate points for each correct answer. The game continues until the player gives an incorrect answer or successfully answers all the questions.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script in a Python environment.
2. You will be presented with the first question and its possible answers.
3. Choose the correct answer by typing the corresponding option (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd').
4. If your answer is correct, you will earn the points associated with that question, and the next question will be displayed.
5. If your answer is incorrect, the game will end, and your total score will be displayed.
