# Python Day 1

This repository contains a Python code file that covers the basics of Python programming. It introduces fundamental concepts such as printing, variables, data types, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Code Explanation

1. **Printing "Hello World"**: The code starts with a simple print statement that displays "Hello World" on the console.

2. **Line Break with Escape Character**: The escape character "\n" is used to break the line and print in a new line.

3. **Customizing Output with "sep" and "end"**: The "sep" parameter is utilized to add a "~" between each value in the print statement. The "end" parameter is used to specify a custom ending for the print statement.

4. **Variables**: Different types of variables are demonstrated, including integers, strings, and booleans. The code also showcases variable manipulation and string concatenation.

5. **Python Data Types**: The code introduces lists and tuples as fundamental data types in Python. It explains their characteristics and usage.

6. **Operators**: Basic arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulus are demonstrated.
