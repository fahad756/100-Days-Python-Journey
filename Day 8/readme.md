# 100 Days of Coding - Day 8

## Code Overview

Welcome to Day 8 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge! In this challenge, we will continue our journey through Python programming concepts. Today's code will focus on lists, list comprehension, and list manipulation.

## Code Details

The code in `main.py` demonstrates the following concepts:

### Lists

The code begins by creating a list named `Randomv`, which contains a mix of integers and strings. It showcases slicing by printing elements from index 0 to index 4 (exclusive) with a step of 2.

### List Comprehension

We explore list comprehension in the following examples:

1. The `lst` list comprehension creates a list of integers from 0 to 3 (exclusive).
2. Another `lst` list comprehension demonstrates arithmetic operation, doubling each element from 0 to 4.
3. The `even` list comprehension generates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 4.

### List Manipulation

We perform various operations on the `numbers` list:

1. We append the value 7 to the end of the list.
2. We sort the list in ascending order.
3. We find and print the index of the value 1 in the list.
4. We create a new list named `lists`, which references the same list as `numbers`. Changing `lists` will also modify `numbers` since they point to the same object.
5. We insert the value 55 at index 1 in the `numbers` list.
6. We extend the `numbers` list by adding elements from the `fahad` list.
7. Finally, we concatenate the `numbers` and `fahad` lists into a new list named `k`.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and run it to see the output. Modify the code or experiment with different values to deepen your understanding of lists, list comprehension, and list manipulation in Python.
